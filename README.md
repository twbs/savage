Savage
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twbs/savage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twbs/savage)

Savage is a service watches for new or updated pull requests on a given GitHub repository. For each pull request, it evaluates whether the changes are "safe" (i.e. we can run a Travis CI build with them with heightened permissions without worrying about security issues) and "interesting" (i.e. would benefit from a Travis CI build with them with heightened permissions), based on which files were modified. If the pull request is "safe" and "interesting", then it initiates a Travis CI build with heightened permissions on a specified GitHub repository. When the Travis CI build completes, it posts a comment with the test results on the pull request. If the test failed, the pull requester can then revise their code to fix the problem.

Savage's original use-case is for running Sauce Labs cross-browser JS tests on pull requests via Travis CI, while keeping the Sauce Labs access credentials secure.

Affectionately named after an experimenter known for "busting" misconceptions, often with explosives.

## Motivation
(Savage is general enough to be used in other situations, but the following is the specific one it was built for.)

You're a member of a popular open source project that involves front-end Web technologies. Cool.

Specifically, the project involves JavaScript. Because it's a serious project, you have automated cross-browser testing for your JavaScript. You happen to use [Open Sauce](https://saucelabs.com/opensauce) for this.

Unfortunately, [due to certain limitations](http://support.saucelabs.com/entries/25614798-How-can-we-set-up-an-open-source-account-that-runs-tests-on-people-s-pull-requests-), it's not possible to do cross-browser testing on pull requests "the obvious way" via Travis CI without potentially compromising your Sauce login credentials. This means that either (a) cross-browser problems aren't discovered in pull requests until after they've already been merged (b) repo collaborators must manually initiate the cross-browser tests on pull requests (and manage the resulting branches, and possibly post comments communicating the test results).

By automating the process of initiating Travis-based Sauce tests and posting the results, cross-browser JavaScript issues can be discovered more quickly and with less work on the part of repo collaborators.

## How it works (for the Open Sauce use-case)
1. Use GitHub webhooks to listen for new or updated pull requests in a given GitHub repository.
2. If the pull request does not modify any JavaScript files, ignore it.
3. Ensure that no sensitive build files (e.g. `.travis.yml`, `Gruntfile.js`) have been modified.
4. Clone the pull request's branch and push it to a test repo under an autogenerated name.
5. Travis CI will automatically run a build on the new branch *under the test repo's user*. Thus, this build will have access to Travis secure environment variables; in particular, it will have access to the Sauce Labs credentials.
6. Use webhooks to track the status of the Travis build.
7. When the build finishes, post a comment to the GitHub pull request explaining the test results, and delete the corresponding branch.

## Used by
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap); see [@twbs-savage](https://github.com/twbs-savage)

## DISCLAIMER
The current authors are not security experts and this project has not been subjected to a third-party security audit.

## Usage
Using Savage involves two GitHub repos (which can both be the same repo, although that's much less secure):
* The *main repo*
  * This repo is the one receiving pull requests
  * Savage needs its GitHub web hook set up for this repo
  * Savage does NOT need to be a Collaborator on this repo
* The *test repo*
  * The repo that Savage will push test branches to
  * Travis CI should be set up for this repo
  * Savage needs to be a Collaborator on this repo, so that it can push branches to it and also delete branches from it

Java 7+ is required to run Savage. For instructions on building Savage yourself, see [the Contributing docs](https://github.com/twbs/savage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Savage accepts exactly one optional command-line argument, which is the port number to run its HTTP server on, e.g. `8080`. If you don't provide this argument, the default port specified in `application.conf` will be used. Once you've built the JAR, run e.g. `java -jar savage-assembly-1.0.jar 8080` (replace `8080` with whatever port number you want). Note that running on ports <= 1024 requires root privileges (not recommended) or using port mapping.

When running Savage, its working directory needs to be a non-bare git repo which is a clone of the repo being monitored.

If you're using Sauce, we recommend [using a sub-account](https://saucelabs.com/sub-accounts) for Savage, to prevent compromise of your main account.

Other settings live in `application.conf`. In addition to the normal Akka and Spray settings, Savage offers the following settings:
```
savage {
    // Port to run on, if not specified via the command line
    default-port = 6060
    // Full name of GitHub repo to watch for new pull requests
    github-repo-to-watch = "twbs/bootstrap"
    // Full name of GitHub repo to push test branches to
    github-test-repo = "twbs/bootstrap-tests"
    // List of Unix file globs constituting the whitelist of safely editable files
    whitelist = [
        "**.md",
        "/bower.json",
        "/composer.json",
        "/fonts/**.{eot,ttf,svg,woff}",
        "/less/**.less",
        "/sass/**.{sass,scss}",
        "/js/**.{js,html,css}",
        "/dist/**.{css,js,map,eot,ttf,svg,woff}",
        "/docs/**.{html,css,js,map,png,ico,xml,eot,ttf,svg,woff,swf}"
    ]
    // List of Unix file globs constituting the watchlist of files
    //   which trigger a Savage build.
    // To prevent unnecessary builds, a Savage build isn't triggered
    // unless the pull request affects a file that matches one of the watchlist globs.
    file-watchlist = [
        "/js/**/*.js"
    ]
    // Prefix to use for branches that Savage pushes to the main repository.
    // The branch name is generated by prefixing the pull request number with this prefix.
    branch-prefix = "savage-"
    // GitHub login credentials for the Savage bot to use
    username = throwaway9475947
    password = XXXXXXXX
    // This goes in the "Secret" field when setting up the Webhook
    // in the "Webhooks & Services" part of your repo's Settings.
    // This string will be converted to UTF-8 for the HMAC-SHA1 computation.
    // The HMAC is used to verify that Savage is really being contacted by GitHub,
    // and not by some random hacker.
    github-web-hook-secret-key = abcdefg
    // Used as a shared secret in a hashing scheme that's used to verify
    // that Savage is really being contacted by Travis CI,
    // and not by some random hacker. For how to find your Travis token,
    // see http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Authorization-for-Webhooks
    travis-token = abcdefg
}
```
